Hi! My name is Danielle. Nice to meet you. My weapons of choice are code and kindness. I tell stories with data @ Uncharted Software.
I value model fairness and interpretability and the impact of algorithmic decision-making on our most vulnerable populations. Because I value interpretability, I invest time in tools that make Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence explainable and accessible. 


Honestly, I do too much. But listen, I have a lot of ideas. Some good, most bad. Here are a few of these things I'm working on:

* #### :honeybee: **Beeknd** 
I'm a huge fan of kindness. I even built an app and started a community to encourage more of it. Check it out here: [Beeknd](http://beeknd.com)
* #### :incoming_envelope: **Algos & Ethics**
I author a monthly newsletter committed to sharing the latest within the intersection of Algorithms and Ethics. Sign-up below if you are interested.

* #### :rice_ball: **MiR Community**
I co-lead an R-focused user group called MiR Community. MiR Community is a slack-based group that supports members of marginalized and vulnerable commmunities that use R. We love R. :purple_heart: :bar_chart:
